= WASM test & demos

Personal repo for WASM experimentation.
Currently, only aims to:

* Build Rust example that compiles and runs in several runtimes
* Run Ruby code using https://github.com/ruby/ruby.wasm[ruby.wasm]
* Setup for Java comparison.

NOTE: The test is bound by the printing and reports similar results in all platform (except for CPU utilization)
Do not use for benchmarking.
